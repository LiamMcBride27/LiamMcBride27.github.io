# My Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site! This page will host my data sources, project ideas, and visualizations.

## Data Sources and Project Ideas

Below are five potential data sources for my final project, each with a link, a brief description, and one idea for analysis.

1. **[Data Source 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ricardobj/recalls-data-from-department-of-transportation)**  
   Comparing Recalls to major events of lawsuits or legislation over time

2. **[Data Source 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rathoddharmendra/post-college-salaries)**  
   Comparing post grad pay of different majors. Perhaps compare that to the whitman majors and gpa.

3. **[Data Source 3](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nilimajauhari/glassdoor-analyze-gender-pay-gap)**  
   Gender pay gap data. I want to compare performance evaluation scores of different jobs with gender.
   
5. **[Data Source 4](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/medical-insurance-payout)**  
   Medical Insurance payout. I want to dig into this data and figure out what groups of people are paying the most for insurance. 

6. **[Data Source 5](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/the-true-cost-of-fast-fashion-impact)**  
   Fast Fashion Imapct. I want to compare this to internet trends in clothing and see the spikes.

## Above and Beyond

For my “above and beyond” element, I plan to:  
- Add a custom navigation bar, extra styling, or additional interactive visualizations.
